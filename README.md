# File Metadata FCC Project
1. I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

### What I Learned
1. Learned use of `multer` to receive file information
